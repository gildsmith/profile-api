## ‚ú® Gildsmith Profile API

The Gildsmith Profile API is a robust Sanctum wrapper designed to simplify
user registration and authentication. It seamlessly integrates with frontend
applications to provide a straightforward registration and authentication
interface along with a customizable user dashboard.

### üì¶ Installation

This API is included as part of the [`gildsmith/gildsmith`](https://github.com/gildsmith/gildsmith)
package. If you are using it, the Profile API is already installed.

To install the Profile API separately, run the following command:

```
composer require gildsmith/profile-api
```

For integrating the web interface, install the corresponding client package:

```
npm i @gildsmith/profile-client
```
