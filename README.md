## ✨ Gildsmith Profile API ✨

The Gildsmith Profile API is a robust Sanctum wrapper designed to simplify
user registration and authentication. It seamlessly integrates with frontend
applications to provide a straightforward registration and authentication
interface along with a customizable user dashboard.

### Installation

This API is included as part of the [`gildsmith/gildsmith`](https://github.com/gildsmith/gildsmith)
package. If you are using it, the Profile API is already installed.

To install the Profile API separately, run the following command:

```
composer require gildsmith/profile-api
```

For integrating the web interface, install the corresponding client package:

```
npm i @gildsmith/profile-client
```

### Alpha Stage Disclaimer

Please note that Gildsmith is currently in the Alpha stage of development.
As such, the core packages are still under active development and may not be
fully functional. We recommend waiting for the first stable release before
using this API in a production environment.
